## Steps we follow
- npx create-react-app ./
- npm run dev [run in dev mode]
- npm i ethers [allows us to connect to the metamask wallet, connect to the eth. blockchain]
- npm i web3modal 
[The Web3Modal SDK allows you to easily connect your Web3 dapp with wallets. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for dapps to request actions such as signing transactions and interacting with smart contracts on the blockchain. The SDK is designed to work with any blockchain, making it easy to support multiple chains without the need for separate integration code]

## The approach
we can route if we want by creating files/folders within the app folder, keep in mind that we no longer use index.js to point to the root, but page.js
